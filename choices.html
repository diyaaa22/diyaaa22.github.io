	With the help of Artificial Intelligence in retail can help to reduce the long lines and waits at a supermarket. It also can reduce the number of human employees. Things like self checkout are already introduced in current supermarkets usually used by customers who would like a quicker shopping experience. An example of this is Amazon Go (Amazon Go, n.d.). With their 'Just Walk Out Shopping' technology it is essentially an advanced version of self checkouts. The only difference is that you can just walk out without even needing to physically go to a checkout or even swiping or tapping your card for payment. <br><br>
	Another example of this is the AI powered Caper Cart or the Caper Counter (Smart Carts & Checkout Systems, n.d.). Inspired by Amazon Go, the Caper Cart helps to eliminate lines by allowing customers to pay straight on their shopping cart. They are able to even take this cart outside to the parking lot in order to load up their items into their car. The Caper team has built two different versions of this cart and a third version is coming soon. As newer technology gets released, they are able to create a better shopping experience with the aid of artificial intelligence. Caper Cart 3 will be slimmer and lighter despite having a portable charger attached to it to provide all day battery. The AI will be able to recognise items placed into or removed from the cart with the help of computer vision and cameras strategically placed in the cart. Customers would also have the option to sync their shopping lists through an app or a QR code as well as search for the location of specific items, allowing the shopping experience to be more enjoyable as well as efficient. The Caper Counter on the other hand is a self checkout kiosk which allows the customer to place items into it and quickly complete their transaction aided by computer vision and cameras. The AI is able to instantly recognise all of the items placed and removed and shows these items on the screen along with the prices and the option to checkout which is basically just an advanced version of our usual self checkout kiosks. Being able to place all of your items into the Caper Counter and having it quickly recognise items makes it the quickest shopping experience ever, all with the help of AI. <br><br>
	In New Zealand, Countdown introduced contactless shopping with their Scan&Go technology using AI (Scan&Go Tech, 2020). The service allows customers to skip regular checkout lines by shopping through an app. They are able to scan, bag and pay for their groceries straight through this app. The app also allows customers to keep a running total making it easier to stay within budget. Scales in the produce area are specially designed to use image recognition - computer vision to identify the fruits and vegetables that a customer is purchasing and make it easier for the customer to check the price of their produce as well. “This trial is not only about testing our new tech, but seeing how our customers respond to a new style of shopping.  Scan&Go will give us some real insight into how Kiwis want to shop and how we can continue to make that easy for them,” says Sally Copland, Countdown's General Manager Brand and CountdownX. <br><br>

		Chatbots/ Virtual Assistants 
	</center>
</h3>
<p>
	Chatbots are another emerging technology that supermarkets are looking into or already using this technology. In New Zealand, there are 3 main supermarkets, Countdown, PAK'n'SAVE and New World and only Countdown uses a chatbot for online customer queries. However, PAK'n'Save has just released a 'Savey MealMaker' which uses artificial intelligence to create recipes using the food you have available at home. (PAK'nSAVE Savey Mealmaker, 2023) <br><br>
	Olive is Countdown's virtual assistant that is available at any time of the day of the week. The 24/7 service allows customers to ask questions that they may have no matter the time or location. Olive can help customers with anything from online queries, order refunds, provide store or product information, report any issues as well as connect you to an actual person if you are needing further help. <br><br>
	In June 2023, PAK'n'SAVE introduced their 'Savey MealMaker' which basically uses artificial intelligence essentially acting like a virtual assistant alongside their iconic mascot, the stickman, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. It has been introduced in order to minimise leftover waste in New Zealand by providing a solution for customers to use up the leftovers in their fridge and pantry before going out and buying more groceries from supermarkets. A minimum of three ingredients are needed for the AI to generate a recipe which makes it easy to finish up a lot of leftovers. Customers can simply enter the ingredients in their fridge and pantry and click the 'Make Me a Meal' button and a recipe will be provided. If they do not like this recipe, they are able to click the 'Refresh Recipe' button and a whole new recipe will be provided. <br><br>
	Both Olive and the Savey MealMaker allow customers to have a better customer experience through instant interactions at any time straight through their websites. For Woolworths and Foodstuffs chains who own Countdown and PAK'n'SAVE, adopting this technology means that they do not have to hire as many people, reducing labour costs as well as enhancing the efficiency of the customer experience. Customers are able to get instant results through the virtual assistants. <br><br>
