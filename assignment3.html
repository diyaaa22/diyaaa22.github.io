	<h2>
		What is Retail Automation?
	</h2>
	<p1>
		Retail Automation is about using technology to improve customer satisfaction and experience during shopping in a supermarket.
		<br>
		It eliminates lines, wait times, and reduces human errors, making it more efficient for both businesses and customers.
		<br>
	</p1>
	<h2>
		How is AI Being Implemented Into Retail?
	</h2>
	<p2>
		Walmart, one of the larget retailers in the U.S. uses AI, to detect when certain shelves need to be restocked, 
		and sends robots to go and fill the empty shelves. This is much more effiecient, than sending a worker to go and 
		do this themself, and find the stock needed.

	<p2>
		Retail Automation is relevant in our society as this technology is already being used around the world and even making its way into
		Auckland, which makes it an important topic for us to learn about. As us as customers are becoming the users of this new type of
		technology, which is certian to become apart of our day-to-day lives in the near future. 
		<br>
		It may become dire for businesses to adopt this technology to stay as a convenient but also competitive option to keep their customers.
	</p2>
	<p3>
		This topic was interesting to all members of our group as it is a new and upcoming area where new technology
		is being used. We were all passionate about learning more about it due to the various pros and cons associated with it.
	</p3>
	<p4>
		All members in our group will oversee all responsibilities; however, each one of us will have specific roles depending on our
		strengths and weaknesses to aid us during this project.
		Some of these roles include being the team leader, designing and creating PowerPoint slides, researching further on the topic,
		designing and developing the website to showcase the project, and gathering information to write on the website, etc.

	<!-- TO DO
		
	walmart, the biggest retailer uses ai to check stock
	and restock shelves.
	amazon go's implications of ai use sensors and cameras, throughout their store, which together, 
	create an intricate almost "spiderweb" which, with machine learning create a virtual image, that can correctly identify and 
	differentiate between customers inside its store, and can see what customers are buying, removing the need for a physical checkout,
	and the need for a checkout clerk.
