	<p>
		Retail Automation is about using technology to improve customer satisfaction and experience during shopping in a supermarket. 
		It eliminates lines, wait times and reduces human errors which makes it more efficient for a business as well the customer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Retail Automation is relevant in our society as this technology is already being used around the world and even in 
		Auckland, making it an important topic for us to also learn about since we could be the users of this new type of 
		technology making it something that will impact our day to day lives in the near future. As Amazon also offers this 
		software and technology, it may become important for business to move to this technology soon, before the competition 
		gains from this.
	</p>
	<p>
		This topic was interesting to all members in our group as it is a new and upcoming topic where there is new technology 
		being used making it something that we were all passionate to learn more about as there are many pros and cons.
	</p>
	<p>
	All members in our group will oversee all responsibilities, however each one of us will have specific roles depending on our 
	strengths and weaknesses to aid us during this project.

	Some of these roles are being the team leader, designing and creating PowerPoint Slides, Researching further on the topic, 
	designing and developing the website in order to showcase the project, gathering information to write on the website, etc.
