	<p>
		Retail Automation is about using technology to improve customer satisfaction and experience during shopping in a supermarket.
		It eliminates lines, wait times, and reduces human errors, making it more efficient for both businesses and customers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Retail Automation is relevant in our society as this technology is already being used around the world and even in
		Auckland, making it an important topic for us to learn about. We could be the users of this new type of
		technology, which will impact our day-to-day lives in the near future. It may become important for businesses to adopt this technology to stay competitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		This topic was interesting to all members of our group as it is a new and upcoming area where new technology
		is being used. We were all passionate about learning more about it due to the various pros and cons associated with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		All members in our group will oversee all responsibilities; however, each one of us will have specific roles depending on our
		strengths and weaknesses to aid us during this project.
		Some of these roles include being the team leader, designing and creating PowerPoint slides, researching further on the topic,
		designing and developing the website to showcase the project, and gathering information to write on the website, etc.
