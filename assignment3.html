		What is Retail Automation?
	</h2>
	<p>
		Retail Automation is about using technology to improve customer satisfaction and experience during shopping in a supermarket as well as optimise tasks
		for the business such as product categorization and inventoryy management.
		<br>
		Self-service checkouts, where customres simply scan and pay for their items, remove the need for a checkout clerk to preform this tasks
		which can greatly optimise the speed of shoppers flowing in and out of the store, as a set amount of machines will decrease the wait times for a shopper to pay,
		and effectively removes lines, significantly increasing customer satisfaction and making it an effiecent use of both the shoppers and business time.
		
	</p>
	<h2>
		How is AI Being Implemented Into Retail?
	</h2>
	<p> 
		AI's goal in retail is to automate mundane tasks, and to make the process of shopping in-store more efficient, 
		to maximise profits for businesses and overall increase customers experience.
		AI is already being used in many simple ways, such as calculating the totals for the customers bills, including
		calculating prices of produce by weight which effectively removes any human error, or any risks of anyone being shortchanged, 
		and can result in the business suffering a loss.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notably, Amazon is pioneering a more extreme implication which they have coined "just-walk-out" technology which,
		 in short, simply removes 
		checkouts, removing lines, which makes it very convenient for the shopper.
		<br>
		The technology behind this revolves around Computer Vision connected to Machine Learning. 
		<br>
		Computer Vision involves an intricate almost "spider web" of cameras located around the store,
		which has an entire vision of the store and customers entering and leaving. <br>
		The Computer has a virtual map of the store and can easily differentiate between different customers and map out 
		where they are in the store. As the customer enters the store they scan a QR code, which sends a message to the server
		 to create a virtual shopping cart for the customer. 
		<br>
		The computer vision can then track the user's movements around the store, and when the shopper picks up an item, it can 
		correctly identify what the item is and adds it to their virtual cart,
		based on where they are in the store. As the customer walks around the computer is constantly detecting if they are still 
		carrying what they picked up, where they are. When the computer detects the shopper to have walked out, 
		an invoice is sent to their Amazon account and Amazon is able to charge them from their credit card.
		<br>
		The customer is able to view their recepits through the Amazon app.
		This removes the need for checkouts, although some customers may wish to use a checkout, or speak to customer services, 
		this is still available , and staff are still present to help any shopper that any needs of assistance.
	</p>
	<h2>
		How is This Relevant To Our Society? Why Should I Care?
	</h2>
	<p>
		It is important that we are knowledgeable about the implementations of such software as it is a rapidly
		growing field and it is likely that this will become the standard practice for retail. Our money is what is the motive for these retailers
		and their innovations, our financial decisions are imporant to how retail fucntions and what current thematics are developed from our own shopping
		habits and as companies seem to want to track our movements it will become increasingly important to be knowledgeable,
		as at the end of the day, our cents are what keep these places profitable and it may become dire
		for businesses to adopt the latest trends in retail as they wish to keep making money and expanding into new areas.

	<!--Research Report-->
	<p>
		A market research report from "Fortune Buisness Insights" was published in 2021 and looked into kiosk market share in 2020. It found globally the market
		share was valued at around $20.29 billion USD. They also projected that it will grow from $22.69 USD 
		billion in 2021 to $51.05 billion in 2029, with a "Compound Annual Growth Rate" of 12.3% during the forecast period.
	</p>
	<p>
		As businesses continue to seek out faster and more convenient ways to increase their porfits, the devlopment of technologies increases the efficiency
		of workers and increases customers' interest and customers convenience. Many may be in a rush and need to quickly grab something, before going to work and returning
		to their more important tasks of the day. So convenience is very important to the average shopper. Time is a limited resource and as customers value it so much, so will
		businesses that should too. Implementing self-service into a retail business also removes the need to hire more checkout clerks which, for businesses who are more willing to 
		spend extra, and value the efficiency will be a lot more willing to invest in this technology to help streamline the demands and needs of customers. The cost of these machines
		can also have a high "return on investment" when compared to the cost of paying workers wages.
	</p>
	<p>
		It has also been reported that self-service kiosks in the form of digital screens in fast food places, such as McDonalds and Subway, which they believe increased the likely hood
		for customers to spend more, aswell as browse the menu longer and customize their orders, having a greater retention time in a fast food restaurant also increase the likely hood
		of customers making a greater purchase. A fast food restaurant in Illiois had found that 
		<i>"kiosks encouraged customers to customize their orders. As a result, the retaurant noticed that orders at the kiosks
			had much higher cheque sizes than counter order."
		</i>
		Where they had reported that kiosk had an average cheque size of $17.17 usd compared to $9.79 usd at the counter.

	<p>
		Retail Automation is relevant to our society as this technology is already being used around the world and even making its way into Auckland,
		which makes it another reason for us to become informed about how they market towards us as we are consumers. As time passes it may become part of
		our day to day lives. It also become dire for businesses to adopt this technology to stay as a covenient but also a competitve option to keep their customers. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This topic was interesting to all members of our group as it is a new and upcoming area where new technology
		is being used. We were all passionate about learning more about it due to the various pros and cons associated with it.
	</p>
	<p4>
		All members in our group will oversee all responsibilities; however, each one of us will have specific roles depending on our
		strengths and weaknesses to aid us during this project.
		Some of these roles include being the team leader, designing and creating PowerPoint slides, researching further on the topic,
		designing and developing the website to showcase the project, and gathering information to write on the website, etc.
