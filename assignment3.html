		What is Retail Automation?
	</h2>
	<p>
		Retail Automation is about using technology to improve customer satisfaction and experience during shopping in a supermarket.
		<br>
		It eliminates lines, wait times, and reduces human errors, making it more efficient for both businesses and customers.
		<br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		How is AI Being Implemented Into Retail?
	</h2>
	<p> 
		AI's goal in retail is to automate mundane tasks, make the process of shopping in store more effiecient, to maximise profits for businesses and overall increase customers experience.
		Walmart,is irrelevant.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notably, Amazon is pioneering a more extreme implication which they have coined "just-walk-out" technology which, in short, simply removes 
		checkouts, removing lines, which makes it very convenient for the shopper.
		<br>
		The technology behind this revolves around Computer Vision connected to Machine Learning. 
		<br>
		Computer Vision involves an intricate almost "spiderweb" of cameras located around the store,
		which has entire vision of the store and customers entering and leaving. <br>
		The Computer has a virtual map of the store and can easily differentiate between different customers and map out 
		where they are in the store. As the customer enters the store they scan a qr code, which sends a message to the system to create a virtual shopping cart for the customer. 
		<br>
		The computer vision can then track the users movements around the store, and when the shopper picks up an item, it can correctly identify what the item is and adds it to their virtual cart,
		based on where they are in the store. As the customer walks around the computer is constantly detecting if they are still carrying what they picked up, where they are, and when the customer, 
		walks out, they simply are charged to their Amazon account where they can also see their receipt.
		<br>
		This removes the need for checkouts, although some customers may wish to use a checkout, or speak to customer services, this is still an option, and staff are still present to help any shopper that 
		requires assistance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Retail Automation is relevant in our society as this technology is already being used around the world and even making its way into
		Auckland, which makes it an important topic for us to learn about. As us as customers are becoming the users of this new type of
		technology, which is certian to become apart of our day-to-day lives in the near future. 
		<br>
		It may become dire for businesses to adopt this technology to stay as a convenient but also competitive option to keep their customers.
	</p>
	<p>
		This topic was interesting to all members of our group as it is a new and upcoming area where new technology
		is being used. We were all passionate about learning more about it due to the various pros and cons associated with it.
	</p>
	<p4>
		All members in our group will oversee all responsibilities; however, each one of us will have specific roles depending on our
		strengths and weaknesses to aid us during this project.
		Some of these roles include being the team leader, designing and creating PowerPoint slides, researching further on the topic,
		designing and developing the website to showcase the project, and gathering information to write on the website, etc.
