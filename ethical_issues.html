	<h3>Ethical Issues</h3>

	<p class="highlighted-paragraph"> Andrew: <br> I believe that there is a lot of worry about the use of AI and there is a lot of speculation about the fears of job loss due to robotic replacement. As there does seem to be a large boom in open-source and easily usable AI, it is almost normal to have at least some worry. As it almost seems very easy for many retail workers, who most of the time will be living on a very fine line of money and may not have good savings accounts to fall back on. So they must have a job to feed their families and pay their rent. But realistically, business owners are not firing humans for their supercomputers, ai is not directly losing people jobs but rather is being used as a tool to help retail workers with some of the more monotonous tasks, although some retailers are creating cashier-less stores, where you could argue is causing job loss in communities, you could argue any form of automation is a job loss and could go to someone in need such as a vending machine even. This boom in the trend of ai automation may simply be a trend and fade out in the next coming years. I do not believe all jobs will be replaced but rather jobs will be enhanced and assisted to be more efficient rather than straight replacement. Retail automation efficiency can greatly increase the quality of customer service and remove a large area of human error, in calculating customers' cheques, and the removal of lines is a desired leisure that I could get behind, I value my time and would rather not wait for someone else groceries before having my turn although this may be selfish I value my time. Some of this technology may be daunting and might confuse some, self-service checkouts are often at times falsely detecting items and can have false readings or easily be cheated, and people can “steal” from stores. Equipment is expensive and can make smaller businesses harder to stay relevant if they cannot afford all the new flashy tech. I do not see many risks behind this implementation rather than job loss, but I only see people's jobs becoming a lot easier, with warehouse workers being able to see where stock is needed and technology like forklifts, you could argue caused jobs to be lost. 4 people don't need to carry a pallet when you have a forklift and a licensed driver. I can only see the automation of retail as an assistance to retail workers' jobs, which is an already mundane task.
