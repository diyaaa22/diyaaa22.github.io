	<h3>Ethical Issues</h3>

	</center>

	<p class="highlighted-paragraph"> Andrew: <br> This group project helped me understand how the general public may feel about the risks and concerns surrounding ai. I think it is important that we are more informed about the use of artificial information as I do not see many problems with it, rather than lazy work being produced. I enjoyed collaborating with my peers and forming newfound friendships, it was a pleasant time being able to plan out our website and be able to effectively communicate to get to the end goal of our web source. It was easy to find a common interest in the topic of AI automation in retail, as it seems to have become rather relevant in today's society, but in more subtle ways such as implementations of self-service checkouts, which I would never have considered an optimization of AI’s usage but how that simple idea, back in the 1940s has paved to way to many other innovations that have got us as a society to implement the technology that we are currently using today. I believe that there is a lot of worry about the use of AI and there is a lot of speculation about the fears of job loss due to robotic replacement. As there does seem to be a large boom in open-source and easily usable AI, it is almost normal to have at least some worry. As it almost seems very easy for many retail workers, who most of the time will be living on a very fine line of money and may not have good savings accounts to fall back on. So they must have a job to feed their families and pay their rent. But realistically, business owners are not firing humans for their supercomputers, ai is not directly losing people jobs but rather is being used as a tool to help retail workers with some of the more monotonous tasks, although some retailers are creating cashier-less stores, where you could argue is causing job loss in communities, you could argue any form of automation is a job loss and could go to someone in need such as a vending machine even. This boom in the trend of ai automation may simply be a trend and fade out in the next coming years. I do not believe all jobs will be replaced but rather jobs will be enhanced and assisted to be more efficient rather than straight replacement. Retail automation efficiency can greatly increase the quality of customer service and remove a large area of human error, in calculating customers' cheques, and the removal of lines is a desired leisure that I could get behind, I value my time and would rather not wait for someone else groceries before having my turn although this may be selfish I value my time. Some of this technology may be daunting and might confuse some, self-service checkouts are often at times falsely detecting items and can have false readings or easily be cheated, and people can “steal” from stores. Equipment is expensive and can make smaller businesses harder to stay relevant if they cannot afford all the new flashy tech. I do not see many risks behind this implementation rather than job loss, but I only see people's jobs becoming a lot easier, with warehouse workers being able to see where stock is needed and technology like forklifts, you could argue caused jobs to be lost. 4 people don't need to carry a pallet when you have a forklift and a licensed driver. I can only see the automation of retail as an assistance to retail workers' jobs, which is an already mundane task.

		This group project has been an amazing opportunity for me. As a group, we were able to learn about each other as well as things that we were all passionate about, making this group project a very fun experience. From the start, we were able to connect over the topic of AI. This allowed us to find out that we were all pretty interested in AI making it very easy to pick a good topic and work on it together. We did not have many issues due to quickly becoming friends although when we did have any issues such as time management/ delays, we were able to quickly resolve the issue by working together and having conversations on what we could do and how we could support each other in meeting deadlines. Usually, I am not a big fan of group projects but getting to know the members in this group and connecting with them so quickly on such a passionate topic was definitely a huge opportunity for me as it allowed me as well as my members to build on skills together as well as individually. The project gave me the opportunity to meet new people and build a friendship with them, making it something I can take away from this project. The assignment overall was done pretty well, to make it better, I would change up a few things like the layout and mostly just the aesthetics. We could have also added a few more points for the opportunities section but overall I think we did a pretty good job. 
		
		There are many ethical issues with Artificial Intelligence retail automation in supermarkets. These include job displacement, privacy or data security breaches, bias from training data, lack of transparency, customer manipulation and exploitation, over relying on technology, unintended results. All of these issues are pretty important for supermarket chains to think about and address before adopting Artificial Intelligence in their supermarkets as they will be held responsible if anything goes wrong. Job displacement is currently a huge ethical issue that most people are worried about. However, it is important to note that there are many things that cannot be automated by Artifical Intelligence and that people are needed to complete a lot of tasks that Artificial Intelligence can’t do. Privacy and data security breaches are also a huge concern as Artificial Intelligence collects a lot of customer data and most customers would be worried about any potential chances of misuse of their personal data. Artificial Intelligence systems are also trained by people making it an issue and unethical if the training data discriminates against certain people or products in a supermarket and provides incorrect data just due to the training data stating unethical things. It would also affect customer service if the Artificial Intelligence system is taught to discriminate against people. Lack of transparency comes into play here as Artificial Intelligence algorithms and the training data may make it harder for people to understand how it is providing information causing people to not believe the Artificial Intelligence model/ virtual assistant. Another unethical point is customer manipulation which basically contradicts the lack of transparency point but it also depends on the algorithm and what it has learnt through the training data. Overreliance on technology is a huge issue as it may cause people to soon lose touch with reality and cause poor judgement and decisions for certain things. Overall, it will be interesting to see how everything plays out with the future of AI expanding rapidly.
