	<h3>Ethical Issues</h3>

	</center>

	<p class="highlighted-paragraph"> Andrew: <br> This group project helped me understand how the general public may feel about the risks and concerns surrounding ai. I think it is important that we are more informed about the use of artificial information as I do not see many problems with it, rather than lazy work being produced. I enjoyed collaborating with my peers and forming newfound friendships, it was a pleasant time being able to plan out our website and be able to effectively communicate to get to the end goal of our web source. It was easy to find a common interest in the topic of AI automation in retail, as it seems to have become rather relevant in today's society, but in more subtle ways such as implementations of self-service checkouts, which I would never have considered an optimization of AI’s usage but how that simple idea, back in the 1940s has paved to way to many other innovations that have got us as a society to implement the technology that we are currently using today. I believe that there is a lot of worry about the use of AI and there is a lot of speculation about the fears of job loss due to robotic replacement. As there does seem to be a large boom in open-source and easily usable AI, it is almost normal to have at least some worry. As it almost seems very easy for many retail workers, who most of the time will be living on a very fine line of money and may not have good savings accounts to fall back on. So they must have a job to feed their families and pay their rent. But realistically, business owners are not firing humans for their supercomputers, ai is not directly losing people jobs but rather is being used as a tool to help retail workers with some of the more monotonous tasks, although some retailers are creating cashier-less stores, where you could argue is causing job loss in communities, you could argue any form of automation is a job loss and could go to someone in need such as a vending machine even. This boom in the trend of ai automation may simply be a trend and fade out in the next coming years. I do not believe all jobs will be replaced but rather jobs will be enhanced and assisted to be more efficient rather than straight replacement. Retail automation efficiency can greatly increase the quality of customer service and remove a large area of human error, in calculating customers' cheques, and the removal of lines is a desired leisure that I could get behind, I value my time and would rather not wait for someone else groceries before having my turn although this may be selfish I value my time. Some of this technology may be daunting and might confuse some, self-service checkouts are often at times falsely detecting items and can have false readings or easily be cheated, and people can “steal” from stores. Equipment is expensive and can make smaller businesses harder to stay relevant if they cannot afford all the new flashy tech. I do not see many risks behind this implementation rather than job loss, but I only see people's jobs becoming a lot easier, with warehouse workers being able to see where stock is needed and technology like forklifts, you could argue caused jobs to be lost. 4 people don't need to carry a pallet when you have a forklift and a licensed driver. I can only see the automation of retail as an assistance to retail workers' jobs, which is an already mundane task.

		In our group project everyone was very active in providing creative ideas as well as having good understanding conversations. We learned a lot throughout this project as we discovered the wonders and excitement of Artificial intelligence. During our first interaction we had really good chemistry with each other, having a few laughs and learning about each other. While on our group discussions we found out that we all have the same idea in the type of AI that we want to focus on. We did not have any disputes with each other with our project, but when we did have some issues we would have group studies and talk about our problems (in our project) and how to deal/go about overcoming difficulties. We really had no issues; it was just time management and delays however we did not let that prolong our project as we addressed it openly and honestly. We had discussions about scheduling our group project and alternative ways of communicating to each other so that everyone is included in the decision making process. To address the tasks for each person in this project we revisited our original plan and distributed responsibilities as well as encouraged regular checkups to make sure everyone was on track.
		
		Despite these challenges, this presented us with good opportunities where we worked well together as a group. We made sure we all gave supportive and respectful feedback to each other with everyone’s ideas being valued. This allowed us to produce high quality work. In working with a group it gave us opportunities to improve our skills, it gave us the chance to improve our communication and collaboration skills as well as our ability to delegate tasks effectively. This was only done with the feedback we gave each other which identified areas for personal growth and development.
		
		Reflecting on the assignment, we can identify areas where we could have done better. One aspect is ensuring clearer roles and responsibilities from the outset to avoid confusion and imbalances. We could have set specific deadlines and established a more structured project plan to keep us accountable and maintain a steady pace of progress. Additionally, more frequent and efficient communication could have helped more with scheduling conflicts and better coordination.
		
		On Ethical issues about Artificial Intelligence in automation. It raised some concerns about the ethical implications of using such technologies. One major ethical consideration was data privacy and security. We had to ensure that the data we collected and processed using AI automation was obtained with proper consent and handled securely. This meant being transparent about our data collection practices, implementing strong security measures to protect sensitive information. Additionally, there were ethical considerations regarding the impact of AI automation on employment and job displacement. As we automated certain tasks through AI, it was important to reflect on the potential consequences for individuals whose jobs could be affected. We had to consider ways to mitigate these impacts, such as by identifying opportunities and finding ways to redistribute the benefits of automation.
		
		We can improve our handling of ethical issues related to AI automation by conducting more thorough ethical impact assessments at the early stages of our projects. This includes considering the potential consequences for privacy, bias, and employment, and actively working to mitigate these risks. We can also stay informed about emerging ethical standards and guidelines in the field of AI to ensure our practices align with the latest best practices.
