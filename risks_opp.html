	<h3>Risks</h3>

	<p>
	Artificial intelligence in marketing, and grocery related industries can bring numerous benefits. As well as certain risks. <br><br>
	</p>
	<h4>Less human interactions </h4>
	<p>
		Automation can eliminate any errors and perform more efficient progress, however it may also lead to no personalisation and human touch. This is a problem for some customers because they may prefer more personalised interactions with real people rather than automated responses. It may affect customer satisfaction and loyalty. The ability of an automated machine cannot comprehend human emotions and social cues, it cannot distinguish a person's body language, the way they speak, their cultural background or any emotional reaction towards a customer. All this means is that it may advertise false or irrelevant and otherwise unnecessary items, making a customer dissatisfied and disappointed with the store's service. Another reason why having less human interactions is a potential risk is the lack of adaptability and flexibility. Having a human marketer means being able to adapt to situations that a customer needs or wants, essentially providing good service that satisfies what they are looking for. This is crucial because there will be an instance where human judgement is needed, where creativity and intuition takes a big role in such occasions. Having AI automation handle these situations will have issues dealing with variable or uncommon scenarios which require quick decision making and an understanding of human behaviour. Lastly, Customers will prefer a more physical level of attention and reaction. Having a machine give the same service does not feel genuine and valued which in turn lose their trust and affect a client's loyalty and satisfaction.
	</p>
	<h4>Technical errors and glitches</h4>
	<p>
		Artificial Intelligence is a machine meaning it is not immune to errors or glitches. If this were to be implemented in marketing, it can result in incorrect product recommendations, as well as pricing errors and miscommunications with customers. This will affect the reputation of the store/establishment and lose customer trust. Artificial intelligence is an algorithm which is programmed to do certain instructions given by their creators. In this instance It can be manipulated to show misleading prices at checkouts which will confuse customers as well as affect their decision on purchasing an item thus resulting in the loss of business. Another way technical errors and glitches can affect the store's sales and service is the reliability of automated marketing. The negative effects of this like, slow response, system crashes, and affect customer experience.
	</p>
	<h4>Data privacy and security</h4>
	<p>
		AI in marketing heavily relies on collecting and analysing customer data. This raises concerns about data privacy and the potential for security breaches. If this sensitive information is somehow obtained by malicious individuals it will show that it is not trustable and reliable to use. When it comes to AI automation, it often requires a customer’s data such as their personal information, their purchasing habits, and more. This is needed for the system to make a specific decision on their next purchase like recommendations and such. However the collection of such data gives concerns pertaining to privacy rights and handling such sensitive information. With AI automation, workers/employees require awareness and training when it comes to customer data. Having a knowledgeable and trustable handler of customers’ sensitive information is essential in maintaining trust and loyalty as well as make it less likely of the possibility of internal data breaches, This will increase the skills required for a worker to be employed in these types of workplace.
